# Image Processing Segmentation Techniques

This repository contains various image processing segmentation techniques implemented in Python. Segmentation is the process of partitioning an image into different regions or objects based on their visual characteristics. The implemented techniques can be used for tasks such as object recognition, image analysis, and computer vision applications.

## Techniques Included

1. **Thresholding**: Segments an image based on a predefined threshold value.
2. **Edge-based Segmentation**: Identifies edges or boundaries between different regions in an image.
3. **Region-based Segmentation**: Divides an image into meaningful regions based on similarity criteria.
4. **Watershed Segmentation**: Utilizes the concept of watershed lines to separate regions in an image.
5. **K-means Clustering**: Groups pixels into clusters based on their color or intensity similarity.
6. **Fuzzy-C Means Based Segmentation**: Shifts data points based on the membership values to form segments.



## Instructions

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Choose the desired segmentation technique from the list above.
3. Open the corresponding C file in an integrated development environment (IDE) or a code editor.
4. Replace the placeholder image file path with the path to your own image.
5. Run the code and observe the segmented output.

Feel free to experiment with different techniques and images to explore the capabilities of image segmentation.
